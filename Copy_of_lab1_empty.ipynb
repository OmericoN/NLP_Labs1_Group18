        "As discussed in the first lectures, tokenization is a fundamental step in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 🧠💬 that transforms raw text into structured data for computational models. In this lab, you will explore different **tokenization techniques** 📝, preprocess text data 🔍, and implement **tokenization pipelines** using popular NLP libraries 🏗️. Next, we explore N-gram language models 📊 as a foundational approach 🧱 to modeling natural language statistically 📈. These models form the conceptual foundation 🧠 of the neural language models 🤖🧠 that we will explore later in the course 🚀📚.\n",

Based on what we saw last year in your deliverables, it's pretty clear when you \"copy\" some code and then you struggle to interpret the results. This is the essence of this course and of the skills you should try build for yourself: Many people can run fancy models these days but not many people can interpret the results correctly. Try to be the latter ones."

        "- `re.search()` - searches for a pattern in a string, returns the first match,\n",
        "- `re.findall()` - similar to `search()`, but returns a list of all matches,\n",
