    "\n",
    "### The Department of Outdated Government Encyclopedias (DOGE) Launches Revolutionary NLP Project to Rescue Public Knowledge  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Washington, D.C.** — In a bold step toward modernizing the nation’s most chaotic digital archives, the   **Department of Outdated Government Encyclopedias (DOGE)** today announced the launch of its new initiative:  🚀 **Project CleanSearch AI**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades, citizens have struggled to find simple answers hidden inside massive, noisy, and poorly structured government knowledge repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- “Who won the Nobel Prize in 1930?”  \n",
    "- “When did Angola become independent?”  \n",
    "\n",
    "have resulted in thousands of irrelevant web pages, confusing biographies and excessive scrolling 📉\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“Frankly, our archives are a mess,”* said a DOGE spokesperson.  \n",
    "> *“They’re long, noisy and about as searchable as a pile of printed Wikipedia pages thrown into a hurricane.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 The Solution  \n",
    "\n",
    "DOGE has assembled an elite team of AI specialists, hired from UM DACS 2nd year bachelor program with the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Clean decades of messy digital text  \n",
    "✅ Extract meaningful knowledge  \n",
    "✅ Replace outdated keyword search with modern **retrieval systems**  \n",
    "✅ Deliver instant, accurate answers to citizens  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using real-world noisy data similar to the government’s archives, the team will experiment with multiple retrieval models to determine the most efficient approach, methods which have been taught in the fabulous classes of some person quoted as J.S. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whispers across the digital corridors suggest that DOGE may soon supercede the legendary Project 2-2, though DACS management insist these rumours are “under control.”\n"

      "{'query': 'In which decade did Billboard magazine first publish and American hit chart?', 'answer': 'The US Billboard song chart The US Billboard song chart Search this site with Google Song chart US Billboard The Billboard magazine has published various music charts starting (with sheet music) in 1894, the first \"Music Hit Parade\" was published in 1936 , the first \"Music Popularity Chart\" was calculated in 1940 . These charts became less irregular until the weekly \"Hot 100\" was started in 1958 . The current chart combines sales, airplay and downloads. A music collector that calls himself Bullfrog has been consolidating the complete chart from 1894 to the present day.  he has published this information in a comprehenive spreadsheet (which can be obtained at bullfrogspond.com/ ). The Bullfrog data assigns each song a unique identifier, something like \"1968_076\" (which just happens to be the Bee Gees song \"I\\'ve Gotta Get A Message To You\"). This \"Whitburn Number\" is provided to match with the books of Joel Whitburn and consists of the year and a ranking within the year. A song that first entered the charts in December and has a long run is listed the following year. This numbering scheme means that songs which are still in the charts cannot be assigned a final id, because their ranking might change. So the definitive listing for a year cannot be final until about April. In our listing we only use songs with finalised IDs, this means that every year we have to wait until last year\\'s entries are finalised before using them. (Source bullfrogspond.com/ , the original version used here was 20090808 with extra data from: the 2009 data from 20091219 the 2010 data from 20110305 the 2011 data from 20120929 the 2012 data from 20130330 the 2013 data from 20150328 The 20150328 data was the last one produced before the Billboard company forced the data to be withdrawn. As far as we know there are no more recent data sets available. This pattern of obtaining the data for a particular year in the middle of the following one comes from the way that the Bullfrog project generates the identifier for a song (what they call the \"Prefix\" in the spreadsheet). Recent entries are identified with keys like \"2015-008\" while older ones have keys like \"2013_177\". In the second case the underscore is significant, it indicates that this was the 177th biggest song released in 2013. Now, of course, during the year no one knows where a particular song will rank, so the underscore names can\\'t be assigned until every song from a particular year has dropped out of the charts, so recent records are temporarily assigned a name with a dash. In about May of the following year the rankings are calculated and the final identifiers are assigned. That is why we at the Turret can only grab this data retrospectively. Attributes The original spreadsheet has a number of attributes, we have limited our attention to just a few of them: 134 9 The songs with the most entries on the chart were White Christmas (with 33 versions and a total of 110 weeks) and Stardust (with 19 and a total of 106 weeks). position The peak position that songs reached in the charts should show an smooth curve from number one down to the lowest position. This chart has more songs in the lower peak positions than one would expect. Before 1991 the profile of peak positions was exactly as you would expect, that year Billboard introduced the concept of \"Recurrent\" tracks, that is they removed any track from the chart which had spent more than twenty weeks in the chart and had fallen to the lower positions. weeks The effect of the \"Recurrent\" process, by which tracks are removed if they have spent at least twenty weeks in the chart and have fallen to the lower reaches, can clearly be seen in the strange spike in this attribute. This \"adjustment\" was intended to promote newer songs and ensure the chart does not become \"stale\". In fact since it was introduced in 1991 the length of long chart runs has increased, this might reflect the more conscious efforts of record companies to \"game\" the charts by controlling release times and promotions, or it coul'}\n",

The Angolan peace process Publication date:\\xa0 David Birmingham When Angola achieved independence in 1975, a war was raging between competing national liberation movements and their foreign backers. Guus Meijer and David Birmingham revisit Angola’s colonial period and the independence struggle that followed and ask how the resulting social and economic divisions shaped and were manipulated by the warring parties. The article describes the introduction of authoritarian one-party rule under the MPLA and the impact of natural resource development and international and regional powers on the conflict. Tracing the conflict up to the signing of the Luena Memorandum, the authors conclude that Angola’s peace remains incomplete and that the country faces many challenges in achieving social and democratic reconstruction. Read full article Angola from past to present On 11 November 1975, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) declared Angola's independence and installed Agostinho Neto as its first President in the former Portuguese colony's capital at Luanda. This outcome had long seemed uncertain and indeed even unlikely; the MPLA had not only had to deal with its own serious internal troubles and disaffections, but had also had to take on the Portuguese colonial army and the two rival armed movements, each backed by powerful allies. Holden Roberto's National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) had initially been the most powerful of the three competing national liberation movements and in the autumn of 1975 it came close to capturing Luanda from the north, backed by a heavily armed force supplied by President Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). In the south, two armoured columns of a South African invasion force, acting in military coordination with the Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas Savimbi, almost reached Luanda before they were stopped by Cuban troops which had been rushed to the assistance of the MPLA. The independent Angolan state was thus born out of turmoil and violence and amid serious national, regional and global rivalries. This heritage with its deep historical roots was to influence the unfolding of events for a long time. Angola, like most African countries, grew out of a conglomerate of peoples and groups each with its own distinct history and traditions. Gradually small local nations and states came into contact with each other and historical developments drove them to share a common destiny under increasing Portuguese influence. Long before the arrival of the Portuguese, Bantu-speaking communities had established a farming economy over most of the territory. They had absorbed many of the scattered Khoisan-speaking populations and developed a successful pastoral dimension to their agriculture as well as building up trading economies. One of the most successfully diverse market centres became the town of M'banza Kongo around which the Kongo kingdom evolved. Further east the concept of state formation related to the political ideology of the Lunda peoples while in the south later kingdoms took shape in the highlands of the Ovimbundu people. Angola under Portuguese rule Although the first Portuguese traders, explorers and soldiers set foot on this part of the African coast from 1483, modern colonisation of the whole territory was only formalised four centuries later after the Berlin Conference of 1884-85. Wide stretches of Angola experienced colonial rule for less than a century, and even after 1900 armed revolts broke out and resistance movements sprang up as among the Ovimbundu and the Bakongo from 1913, until the last northern resistance was put down in 1917. During its century of overrule the colonial regime left crucial marks on Angolan society.

    "## 6. Evaluating Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last section we will try to evaluate how good our sentence retrieval system is. To keep the computational resources manageable, we will use the test set for that as its size is more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the lecture in IR that there are several metrics to evaluate retrieval performance by taking into account the relevance of the retrieved results to the query. We will use Recall@K here (for more metrics and more details refer to the lecture slides and the textbooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall@K is a metric used to measure the effectiveness of a search system in retrieving relevant documents within the top $K$ retrieved documents. It calculates the proportion of relevant documents retrieved within the top-$K$ results, compared to the total number of relevant documents in the collection.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\text{Recall@K} = \\frac{\\text{Number of relevant documents retrieved in the top }-K}{\\text{Total number of relevant documents}}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we have a sentence, and it's compressed version. To test our system, we will treat compressed sentences as the queries. Each query will have only a single relevant sentence - the corresponding uncompressed sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for the calculation of Recall@K we will take into account whether the correct retrieved result is contained within the first $K$ retrieved results. For example, if for a query (i.e. a compressed sentence) we retrieve 10 results and within these we see the relevant one (i.e. the full sentence), then Recall@10 = 1."
