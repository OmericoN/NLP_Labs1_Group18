Transformers are one of the most influential architectures in handling sequences (not only in language). As we discussed in lectures, they excel at taking into account context (which is the salt-and-pepper of NLP) with mechansisms such as self-attetion, which allows them to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence. If you want to know more, revisit the course material (slides and textbook).\n",

      "OK, I have been a huge fan of the Black for a long time and was DISGUSTED after seeing this film. Let's name the problems...First this film has much of the same crew that the first two had. It has also been called the PREQUEL to the original Black Stallion. Why is it that they can't get Shetan's dam's name correct or her color?? In The Black Stallion Returns, we learn the Sagr was the Black's CHESTNUT mother and in this film she is a gray mare name Jenny?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it's set in Africa in 1946 and 1947...I could be wrong but the first one was set in the 1940's as well when the ship wrecks. Time line doesn't sound quite right to me. Also, as a goof, there is a friesian in the beginning of the movie that is supposed to be Shetan's father...upon further notice it appears to be a gelding. Ben Ishaak is the only character that remained to even make this film appear to be related to the previous two in any way. Might be a cute family film to some but it's my biggest movie disappointment of the year.\n",

      "From actor and independent writer/director John Cassavetes, A Woman Under the Influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental instability. The husband, Nick (played by Peter Falk) is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife, Mabel (played by Gena Rowlands) the amount of attention that she deserves. From the onset of the film, it is obvious that Mabel is very quirky and strange, but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that. Crazy. Bonkers. Out of her damn mind. Nick tries his hardest to hide this from his co-workers, and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner, he asks her if she'll be okay, as if he's trying to deny Mabel's illness. Her problem only spirals from there.<br /><br />I did find some particular problems with this film. I guess these problems were mostly present in the story, and the way some of the character acted toward the end. Mabel has been committed, because, frankly, she's nuts. Then, six months later, she's ready to come out of the hospital, and her husband throws a party to welcome her back. He never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie. Why would he invite all these people, some of them strangers to Mabel, over to his house when his wife is in such a fragile state? It's simply idiotic. Later, after Mabel comes in the house, Mabel's father has a huge outburst at Nick, screaming at the top of his lungs about not wanting to eat spaghetti. His daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation, and the thing you want to do is keep her calm, and he goes nuts over spaghetti? A few minutes later in the film, Nick brings Mabel into the stairwell and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable; make her weird noises and gestures. Didn't he send her there to make her better and not do those things? There were various other parts that occurred after this, but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail. I guess I just had a serious problem with the decision by Cassavetes to have his characters act in this way. It simply didn't make sense.<br /><br />However, although I had problems with the ending of the film, there was one aspect that really redeemed it; the acting. Gena Rowlands played an amazing crazy woman. There were times when I forgot she was acting, where I got so caught up in her wild gesticulations and crazy talk that I was actually scared of her. She was amazingly convincing and intense. However, I was also impressed by the rest of Mabel's family. Peter Falk played a very strange character, and I almost thought he was crazy himself, because of the awkward way he handled his children, his job, and especially the situation with his wife. I also usually don't appreciate child actors. But the young people who played Nick and Mabel's children in this film were phenomenal. It really felt like they were Mabel's children, because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem. I think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together, and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intense.<br /><br />In general I wasn't impressed by this film. The story was jumbled and unclear, and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who wasn't insane in the movie. The only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the Longhetti family. Their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together, and are probably the only reason the film has ever amounted to anything.\n",

      "It's cheesy, it's creepy, it's gross, but that's what makes it so much fun. It's got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable. This movie is great to make fun of. Rent it for a good laugh.<br /><br />The film centers around three women newscasters, during a time way before cellphones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can't get a room to stay the night. And that's when they meet Ernest Keller. He's creepy in a Psycho kind of way. And he offers to let them stay at his home. But he doesn't tell them the truth about who lives there.<br /><br />Stephen Furst's performance is so amazing as \"The Unseen\", that he really carries this film. Most of the movie is kind of dull, although finding out the truth of Ernest's family is kind of interesting. <br /><br />Just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make nice eye candy. <br /><br />I consider the movie an old gem, hard to find and worth a look.\n",

      "What? You were not aware that Scooby-Doo battled zombies? Well, you might also not be aware of this little film that was directed by Victor Halperin, who had also directed White Zombie four years earlier. That would probably make it the second zombie film made.<br /><br />No, don't go looking for Dorothy Stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie films, and don't even look for any brains being eaten. This is 1936, you know.<br /><br />So, what you will see is typical of the period - lots of talking.<br /><br />You do get to see Dean Jagger (Twelve O'Clock High ) and Bela Lugosi's eyes, but that is about it.

      "The Haunting, if you have seen the original, you know a great ghost story, it's perfection on film. It's a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements, it terrified people. It still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film. So when The Haunting was remade in 1999, a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction \"WHAT? WHY? WHAT THE\" But in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation, I'm pretty cool with it. This is definitely not the case, this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and I guarantee will deliver no scares pfft! PG-13, what where they thinking? Not much apparently.<br /><br />When her mother dies and her sister evicts her, Nell receives a phone call, telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by Doctor David Marrow at Hill House, a secluded manor. Upon arrival, Nell meets Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark. Shortly thereafter, two other participants in the study arrive, wild Theo and \"bad sleeper\" Luke Sanderson along with Doctor Marrow. Unknown to the participants, Doctor Marrow's true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear. Each night, the caretakers chain the gate outside Hill House, preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning, when the caretakers open the lock. There are no working telephones inside Hill House and the nearest town is several miles away. Doctor Marrow revels the story of Hill House. The house was built by Hugh Crain, Crain built the house for his wife, hoping to fill it with a large family full of children, however all of Crain's children died during birth. Crain's wife killed herself before the house was finished, and Crain became a recluse. The first night, Theo and Nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house, including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes. Nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words \"Welcome Home, Eleanor\", and becomes extremely distraught, setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by Crain's cruelty. She learns that Crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him. He then burned the bodies in the house's fireplace to hide any evidence. She also learns that Crain had a second wife named Carolyn, of whom Nell is descended. Everyone thinks she's crazy while Nell is convinced this is where she belongs.<br /><br />Seriously, I suggest you stay away from this film, it's really stupid and pointless. Not to mention the actress the played Nell, Lili Taylor completely annoyed me, her performance, her look, just everything about her, don't get me started on things I would do just to not see her in film again. Catherine Zeta Jones just didn't fit in her role as well and Liam Neeson, a wonderful actor wasted talent once again. The effects are way over the top and too computerized, I just can't believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud. Believe me, if you are going to be afraid of something, be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupid. Oh, this film is already hurting me, just don't see it, it's bad.<br /><br />1/10\n",

Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale.

The changes made in the V2 version were primarily adding more positve and negative words, as well as accounting for negated tokens. In our cleaning functions we turn negations into one token by connecting words like \"not good\" into one token like \"not_good\". In the v2 version we count these negated tokens as well as the ratio of negated tokens and add them to the feature vector. Adding new positive and negative words led to more reviews triggering positive and negative matches which drastically improved the coverage. Furthermore the negation specific features introduced a completely new signal to the classifier, likely also positively affecting the performance. \n",

This version also introduces a larger corpus that covers all punctuation symbols (imported from `string`). V4 also adds a new feature: log-odds that proposes another way to determine the difference between the 2 sentiments (positive and negative). Overall is more robust and written in a pythonic way that follows the recommended principles.\n",

    "#### Answer Exercise 4 \n",
    "\n",
    "We added the following metrics: **F1 Score, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons for adding each metric are presented in the following paragraph. Accuracy alone already provides a general overview of the model performance but cannot distinguish between different types of erros in classification. To also take into account the false positves and false negatives we decided to add precision and recall to seperatetly evaluate how reliable positive predictions are (precision) and how well the model detects actual positive reviews (recall). We also added the F1-score because it combines the precision and recall which makes it more informative than accuracy alone. The Confusion matrix simply provides an overview of the distribution of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives and False Negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtained Results: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy**: 0.7776\n",
    "\n",
    "**F1 Score**: 0.7892342683851402\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision**: 0.7620790629575402\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall**: 0.8183962264150944\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confusion Matrix**: TN = 1806, FP = 650, FN = 462, TP = 2082\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting observation is that **Recall > Precision**. The model detects most positive reviews as positive, indicated by the high recalll of about 81%. However this comes at the cost of predicting some negative reviews as positive. The confusion matrix confirms that the false positives occur more often than the false negatives (650 > 462) altough the dataset is balanced. This indicates a mild bias towards predicting positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important observation is that **Recall > F1 score > Precision**. This behaviour is expected, as the F1 score represents the harmonic mean between the Precision and Recall. The F1 score balances the trade-off between detecting positive reviews and avoiding incorrect positive predictions. The relatively high F1 score indicates that the classifier achieves a good balance between identifying most positive reviews and limiting false positive predictions. \n",

Default is 'lbfgs'.<br>To choose a solver, you might want to consider the following aspects:<br><br>- 'lbfgs' is a good default solver because it works reasonably well for a wide<br>  class of problems.<br>- For :term:`multiclass` problems (`n_classes >= 3`), all solvers except<br>  'liblinear' minimize the full multinomial loss, 'liblinear' will raise an<br>  error.<br>- 'newton-cholesky' is a good choice for<br>  `n_samples` >> `n_features * n_classes`, especially with one-hot encoded<br>  categorical features with rare categories. Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale.

PyTorch tensors are similar to numpy arrays. They hold data in a multidimensional array or matrix. The difference is that PyTorch tensors can be placed and modified on the GPU which greatly improves the speed of execution.\n",

This has to do with the classification objective from the original paper, where two sentences were given and the model had to predict if they are connected. Because we only included a single sentence, we have only zeros here. We will not be concerned with it in this lab.\n",
    "- `attention_mask` - holds the mask that the model will use to determine if the tokens in the `input_ids` are the real tokens or *padding*. Padding is a technique used to ensure that all input sequences have the same length. BERT (like many other NLP models) process data in batches and requires each sequence in a batch to have the same length, so sequences that are shorter than the maximum sequence length in the batch are padded with special tokens. In this case, because we only inputted a single sentence, the mask contains only ones. Later you will see examples where this is not the case."

(obviously filmed in hollywood, not_washington, dc). this movie is joke. it is not_worth your time.', 'inarguably one of most interesting filmmakers of last 50 years, werner herzog has been pushing boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. i\\'ve been acquainted with herzog for few decades now and i\\'ve never not_been impressed by both man and his work. last year i went to see rescue dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream film was, yet could not_help but imagine herzog taking his actors and crew into actual jungle to not_only make film, but to live it. no other filmmaker is as crazed about purity of film-making process and subsequent lore from such productions as fitzcarraldo has been forged into cinematic legend.today i sat down to fata morgana, 1969 herzog film that could be described as allegorical filmic postcard. without researching actual locations, i\\'m assuming it was shot somewhere in africa, both coastal and desert, region that could have once been cradle of infant man, infant civilization, infant life on earth. it is these origins, biblical notion of garden of eden and apocalypse that herzog is concerned with, as is voiced by narration dispensed throughout 79 minute run time.watching fm i could not_help but feel i was passenger on profound journey. in opening sequence, title is translated as \"mirage\" and herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple repetitions of commercial jets landing on airstrip. these images are perverted, their 3-dimensionality crushed flat by long lens, piling layers of exhaust, heat waves and light aberrations all on top of one another. effect left me to conclude: things are not_as they seem.fm is divided into 3 very distinct chapters: 1) creation, 2) paradise and 3) golden age. chapter one, opens with countless, languid images, where bleak, barren landscapes scroll by, dead animals rot, broken shells of crashed airplanes and abandoned cars slowly disintegrate in desert sun. people populating this inhospitable landscape are ragged, unsmiling and apparent prisoners of desert. narration talks of time before life, time where canvas of earth was blank and all that existed were heavens. while narration hearkens to simpler, purer era, portrait of young boy holding fox-like animal by its throat evokes chilling depiction of man\\'s cruel, ruthless attempt to enforce dominion over nature.in next chapter we are introduced to more of same, yet images and people are more animated and seem infused with modicum of life and vitality. we listen to goggled biologist talk about difficultly monitor lizard has hunting for prey in such lifeless environment. as he holds squirming monitor, its tongue flicking at flies, he also describes how difficult it to capture these creatures in searing 140 degree heat. parallel is duly noted and herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated, candid portraits of individuals battered by sun, desert and laborious efforts required to exist in this harsh realm. he also pushes forward theme that if not_in control, man asserts his control over his environment and not_always in most pleasant of ways.the last chapter takes us out of desert\\'s blast furnace and into more familiar herzog territory populated by eccentrics and absurd behavior. no one seems to have more effective symbiotic relationship with oddballs of world than herzog -- possibly this is where he feels most at home. much like errol morris, herzog chooses to place his camera in as seemingly objective position as he can before he lets film roll. subsequent flirtation herzog has with his subject is result of him being able to continue shooting well beyond point when most directors would have yelled cut. as morris does, this extended roll pushes past \"on\" moment subjects feel obliged to offer and through their discomfort of being pushed into overtime, their facade gives way to something real. most humorous portrait in this chapter is of 2 person band playing odd, polka-like song that herzog recycles throughout this chapter. drummer of band wears same goggles as biologist, as does another guy doing magic trick, begging question: what\\'s with goggles? they definitely add some levity to film, but one has to wonder if they hold any deeper meaning or significance, or is this just another example of herzog\\'s playfullness.the narration aside, herzog utilizes folk and blues music as experimental documentary\\'s soundtrack. leonard cohen grabs most screen time, two of his beautifully melancholic songs \"so long marianne\" and \"suzanne.\" perfectly accompany scrolling landscapes, adding to convincing feel that we are truly along for ride. by end of journey, herzog comes back to one of many shots that recur throughout film: distant framing of lone vehicle traversing endless desert engulfed by water mirage that fills horizon. despite overall bleakness of fm, crescendo of film and mirage motif leave you with hopeful spirit, belief that against all odds, life will persevere and possibly even flourish.having finished writing this post, i referenced fm to discover that herzog shot it in saharan cameroon only weeks after bloody coup. true to his legend, herzog and his crew were arrested, beaten and imprisoned. while imprisoned, herzog fell ill with schistosomiasis, blood parasite. it\\'s truly hard not_to love such hypnotic and austere film as fata morgana; knowing filmmaker was willing to die to get it made only makes you respect it all more.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/']\n",

), and that did not _ redeem movie at all. the only thing that might have been good at all were ghost children type characters that were purposefully badly done in cgi to make it look like they were from game, and who were obviously stolen from japanese horror movies. to be honest, it was hilariously bad, and something i ' d expect from midnight showing of made - for - tv b grade sci - fi channel movie. do not _ expect more than that and you ' ll have great time. just do not _ get soda or you ' ll spit it everywhere when you get great lines like : \" why did you bring that game into our

In our case those would be `BertForMaskedLM` or `BertForNextSentencePrediction` instead of our `BertModel`, which is loaded automatically as the `AutoModel`. Below is a way to load the weights into a different model."
