Transformers are one of the most influential architectures in handling sequences (not only in language). As we discussed in lectures, they excel at taking into account context (which is the salt-and-pepper of NLP) with mechansisms such as self-attetion, which allows them to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence. If you want to know more, revisit the course material (slides and textbook).\n",

      "Okay, let me start off by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone who's read the other comments. That being said, MY G-D, THIS MOVIE REEKED! I mean, WOW, I didn't know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did at something and still come out worse than ANY Roger Corman movie! Corman was probably pitched this movie at some point but declined due to the poor quality of the script! The only reason this movie got made in the first place is that someone said, 'Hey, Zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What game can we get a hold of that has zombies in it? Resident Evil? No, someone else got there first. Silent Hill? No, too silent. People will never sit in a dark room just to be scared silly. Hey, didn't Sega have a game where people ran around shooting zombies? They're out of the platform biz, we could get that for pennies!'<br /><br />Basically they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game, even down to shooting the combat as if the characters were actually playing the game.<br /><br />The first and major problem is that the original game was horrid. I mean,<br /><br />bad-movie-merchandising-made-into-a-worse-game-in-two-weeks-and-then-shippe d-out-and-bought-by-morons-and-their-parents-for-christmas horrid. The graphics were boring. The monsters were boring. The levels were boring. The interface was boring. The CASE was boring. In other words, this was a boring game. And that was the ARCADE version. The home version was even worse! With the home version, you didn't even get the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were being bored silly by this pointless game! But I digress.<br /><br />The second problem is that they went so far as to actually intercut scenes from actual gameplay during the fight scenes. HUH??? Didn't the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual fight going on? Not to mention that EVERY fight was shot from the perspective of a video game, which may explain the tedious use of Matrix-style effects. The problem with this is that the game was a first-person shooter (the player proceeds from the POV of the character). Maybe that's why they put in the game graphics, to let you know that they were alluding to the game... Right, whatever...<br /><br />Anyway, the only thing that made this ENTIRE experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud, so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general incredulity were taken as commonplace and didn't get me kicked out.<br /><br />To sum up, DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Don't even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of week. Run. Just run.\n",

      "\"Such a Long Journey\" is a well crafted film, a good shoot, and a showcase for some good performances. However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master of none. Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours. Recommended for those with an interest in India.\n",

      "Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title!! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE. On top of that, we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to \"tone it down\" or make it \"realistic,\" but it ends up just boring. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about, either. Also, there's no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /><br />However, I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /><br />I'm all for independent films, but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /><br />\"worse than Scarecrow slayer.\"\n",

      "The influence of Hal Hartley in Adrienne Shelly's \"I'll Take You There\" is not overt, but clearly has ties to his work (Shelly has acted in two of Hartley's films). Not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative, but the hyper-stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light. Though this film is not ironic on the whole (thank God), the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss. With beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies, \"I'll See You There\" is a great indie-film that doesn't stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion.<br /><br />The film begins with Bill's life falling to pieces. Not only has he sold his best friend Ray a beautiful country home, but his wife Rose has left him in order to join Ray in the retreat. All washed up, Bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister Lucy (played by the director Adrienne Shelly) brings him all kinds of surprises: a self-help book and a \"date\" for her traumatized brother.<br /><br />The unwilling Bill tries to refuse, but the sudden appearance of Bernice at his door leaves him no choice. No doubt Bernice's initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to \"rebound\" with her. However, her pseudo-hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date. And Bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him, forcing herself upon him. To what end, we are not aware... except for maybe the fact that she is psycho. (And who better to play the psycho than Ally Sheedy?)<br /><br />Aware that Bill desperately wants to see Rose, Bernice offers her car, but on the condition that he take her somewhere first. On the way, she proceeds to hold Bill prisoner with his own gun (a Pinkerton Detective, no less). An imbroglio of angst, resentment, redemption, passion and violence ensue as Bill and Bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of Ray and Rose... of course, with a few stops along the way.\n",

Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale.

    "#### Answer Exercise 4 \n",
    "\n",
    "We added the following metrics: **F1 Score, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons for adding each metric are presented in the following paragraph. Accuracy alone already provides a general overview of the model performance but cannot distinguish between different types of erros in classification. To also take into account the false positves and false negatives we decided to add precision and recall to seperatetly evaluate how reliable positive predictions are (precision) and how well the model detects actual positive reviews (recall). We also added the F1-score because it combines the precision and recall which makes it more informative than accuracy alone. The Confusion matrix simply provides an overview of the distribution of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives and False Negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtained Results: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy**: 0.7776\n",
    "\n",
    "**F1 Score**: 0.7892342683851402\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision**: 0.7620790629575402\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall**: 0.8183962264150944\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confusion Matrix**: TN = 1806, FP = 650, FN = 462, TP = 2082\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting observation is that **Recall > Precision**. The model detects most positive reviews as positive, indicated by the high recalll of about 81%. However this comes at the cost of predicting some negative reviews as positive. The confusion matrix confirms that the false positives occur more often than the false negatives (650 > 462) altough the dataset is balanced. This indicates a mild bias towards predicting positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important observation is that **Recall > F1 score > Precision**. This behaviour is expected, as the F1 score represents the harmonic mean between the Precision and Recall. The F1 score balances the trade-off between detecting positive reviews and avoiding incorrect positive predictions. The relatively high F1 score indicates that the classifier achieves a good balance between identifying most positive reviews and limiting false positive predictions. \n",

To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with<br>   a scaler from :mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`.<br><br>.. seealso::<br>   Refer to the :ref:`User Guide <Logistic_regression>` for more<br>   information regarding :class:`LogisticRegression` and more specifically the<br>   :ref:`Table <logistic_regression_solvers>`<br>   summarizing solver/penalty supports.<br><br>.. versionadded:: 0.17<br>   Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) descent solver.

PyTorch tensors are similar to numpy arrays. They hold data in a multidimensional array or matrix. The difference is that PyTorch tensors can be placed and modified on the GPU which greatly improves the speed of execution.\n",
    "- `token_type_ids` - this tensor holds the information about the index of the sentence. This has to do with the classification objective from the original paper, where two sentences were given and the model had to predict if they are connected. Because we only included a single sentence, we have only zeros here. We will not be concerned with it in this lab.\n",
    "- `attention_mask` - holds the mask that the model will use to determine if the tokens in the `input_ids` are the real tokens or *padding*. Padding is a technique used to ensure that all input sequences have the same length. BERT (like many other NLP models) process data in batches and requires each sequence in a batch to have the same length, so sequences that are shorter than the maximum sequence length in the batch are padded with special tokens. In this case, because we only inputted a single sentence, the mask contains only ones. Later you will see examples where this is not the case."
